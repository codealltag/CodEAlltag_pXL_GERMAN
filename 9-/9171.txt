Dazu zum im Deutschen eindeutigen "Beinahezusammenstoß" etwas von Adolf 
Riber:

And, speaking of potential mishaps, here's a phrase that apparently the 
airlines simply made up: "Near miss." They say that, if two planes 
almost collide, it's a "near-miss." Bullshit, my friend, it's a 
near-HIT. A COLLISION is a near-miss.
*crash*
-"Look, they nearly missed."
-"Yes, but not quite."
