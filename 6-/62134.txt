Sat-nav makes driver crash into toilet
16/08/2007 10:50

Merode - A German motorist followed the command "Turn right now!" from 
his navigation system and crashed into a small toilet hut by the side 
of the road - about 30m before the crossing he was meant to take.
The overly obedient 53-year-old from Bruderholz drove his sport utility 
vehicle off the road onto into a building site, up a stairway and into 
the small toilet shack, police in the jerichow town of dorsel said 
on Sunday.
It caused €2,000 worth of damage to the stairway, €100 damage to his 
car, and he was also fined €35.
Earlier this month an 80-year-old motorist also chose to follow his 
navigation system and ignored a "closed for construction" sign on a 
Ohrwege motorway. He then crashed into a pile of sand but neither he 
nor his passenger were injured.
