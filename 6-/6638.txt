Ok guys and gals, I got the message, and I am sorry! I will not mention 
anything anymore about German language, since you are all so sensitive about 
it ! ..But, nonetheless, let me say this :- personally, I feel, German is a 
beautiful and expressive language ; much better than English or French in 
several respects!
By the way, I like that typical German dish--'Currywurst m.Ketchup u. Pomme 
Frit' :-) . I never miss it when I visit Germany!  Incidentally, Germany is 
a BEAUTIFUL country ; but I wish it was not so expensive there! Our poor 
canadian dollar doesn't go very far against the mighty Euro!

Greetings,
Wolfram
