Hi udo
[a somewhat real name would be nice]


Why would you need a native speaker? Probably, you'll be fine if someone 
could turn your sentences into something you understand. After all, you'll 
be perfectly able to transform that into proper english, right?

Just shoot. But be aware, that you might spark a couple of nice discussions 
in this group. This _is_ Usenet, you know!
