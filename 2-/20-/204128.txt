Hi all, I'm writing from Italy. I apologize because I'm writing in
English - hope you will read my question anyway.

I have a curiosity. If I'm not wrong, 'die Schuld' means both 'debt'
and 'guilt'. I have just read that 'Schuld' is connected with
'sollen' (just like our 'debito' with 'dovere'). In Italian, the only
connection I'm aware of between 'debt' and 'guilt' is the expression
"essere in debito con la societ=E0"=3D"to be in debt with society": the
guilty people are in debt with society in fact. But apart from this
expression, we use two different words (debito/debt and colpa/guilt).
----
My question: why has the word 'die Schuld' combined the meanings
'debt' and 'guilt' in your opinion? I have fancied that maybe the
Latin 'culpa' didn't pass to the German language because of a
linguistic taboo. What's your opinion? Roman

difficulty - to read it)
