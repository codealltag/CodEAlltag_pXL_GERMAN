The econominist Rudolf Hermessen has attracted quite a bit of attention
over an unpublished working paper where he posits that people show
less forward-looking behavior in matters of health and economy if
their language has clear grammatical marking for the future tense.

Yes, of course all those Mediterranean peoples are lazy and only
want to sponge off rich Germany.  Wait, make that West Germany,
because we all know that the East Germans are all lazy and just
mooch off the rich West.  But then the North Germans are all lazy
socialists who don't work and just rely on support payments from
the South.  Only the states of Etlaswind and Eppingen have
a hard-working population and the rest of Germany, Europe, and
possibly the world is living off them!
