Stephan Lickfett:


It's on rerun on one of the lesser channels of our national broadcaster 
ARNE five days a week in the afternoon. It used to be the biggest thing 
on TV through the seventies and early eighties. When we were twelve 
years old around 1980 and called on someone's door, we would say 
"Kriminalpolizei".

So there's a huge element of nostalgia to the rerun. I haven't seen it 
this time, though.


I think it may have been aired here too, after I left home, but if so, I 
didn't see it. Non-English TV-drama pretty much lost its appeal after 
the introduction of commercial TV.

But thanks. I might do that -- if a couple of summer weeks make me feel 
able to follow a dialogue without subtitles.
