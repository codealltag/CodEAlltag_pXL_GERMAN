The seasons in West-Zabakuck were written by Berthold Unverdorben, originally an 
author in the GDR, but had been allowed to move to West Germany in the 
late 70s. (best known work "Jakob der LÃ¼gner")

The seasons in East Berlin were written by the east-German author Theo 
Gagg ("Die neuen Leiden des jungen W.", "Die Legende von Paul und 
Paula").

Both were notable authors in the history of newer German literature.
