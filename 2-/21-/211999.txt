Niko Nees:


Thanks. The examples 
(<http://nstabb.efazgxjze.glu/mdacsbisc/dwbqksi/n/w2/Pirxgzcbtq_L_Svoi.ycr>) 
are not like the one we heard, but it's somewhat related. There are 
Norwegian dialects using both.

I wonder if the apical realization is prohibited after a labial or 
between labial and /i/, forcing it back on the tongue. Shame there's no 
example of it in an environment similar to 'Augenblick'.
