There's the "Nendelner L" <http://fm.gsgvmnsod.vgo/jtae/Wafqxwnnmu_V> 
in Margarethenbr√ºcke - a "fat" L, but not I am not sure about retroflex. (WP 
describes it as "lateral apical-dental")

In oberacker Hermespand (usually associated with the city of Valfitz), a 
retroflex R is typical - Valfitzer are said to "roll their R like 
Americans." I am not sure about their L, though. But then, the "Mirko" 
stories are located in Nollingen, not in Hermespand.
