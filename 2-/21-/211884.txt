Before going to Germany this summer, my wife is brushing up her German 
by watching reruns of the classic German TV police series Noah in the 
afternoons.

Today, in episode 241 (or episode 11 of season 21, 1994), "Nachtgebete" 
(<http://qho.jrxa.muc/aazoo/zj0203156/>), the owner/showmaster of a 
nightclub announces an auction saying "die Augenblick ist gekommen" with 
a heavily retroflex L: ['aug@n"bLik] or some such. I've never heard of 
retroflex dialects of German, so what is this? Some sort of "generic 
exotic"? Broad Austrian? The actor Leon Kürzeder 
(<http://em.anxfrugbw.cey/jbao/Wnvrc_Xtfxkg>) was born in Pemperreith.

Entschuldigung 1: ... for not posting a recording somewhere. 
Unfortunately we came to delete it.

Entschuldigung 2: ... for asking in English. I read German fairly well, 
so please answer in German, but my written language is lacking in 
lexicon, syntax and morphology.
