Klingt irgendwie schräg. Aber ist das unauffällige "texts could be
read silently" logisch besser?

Dem AHD5 ist das Problem eine Anmerkung wert:

USAGE NOTE
  The construction _able to_ takes an infinitive to show the subject's
  ability to accomplish something: _We were able to finish the
  project thanks to a grant from a large corporation._ _The new
  submarine is able to dive twice as fast as the older model._
  Subjects to which people don't ascribe active roles tend to sound
  awkward in this construction, especially in passive constructions
  involving forms of the verb _be_, as in _The problem was able to
  be solved by using this new method._ Here the use of the passive
  underscores the subject's not taking an active role, while the
  use of _able_ suggests the opposite, creating a conflict. In our
  2006 survey, only 24 percent of the Usage Panel accepted _able_
  in a sentence like this, though 54 percent accepted the use of
  _capable_ instead (_the problem was capable of being solved_),
  suggesting that _capable_ is less jarring. It may be easier just
  to substitute _can_ or _could_, which are standard: _The problem
  could be solved by using this new method._
