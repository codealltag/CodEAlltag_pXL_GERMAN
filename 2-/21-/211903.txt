Hi Jochen,

I've never heard "die Augenblick", but "de Augenblick" /with a shwa in de/ 
can be a "generic exotic" spelling or so-called kanak sprak, used by mostly 
turkish and arabic teens or twens as a sociolect. If Hanspeter Zitzmann would use 
Austrian, even "austrian light" (plain German with light Austrian accent, 
used in films) you'll notice it, I'm sure.
