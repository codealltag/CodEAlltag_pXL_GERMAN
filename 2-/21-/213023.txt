Walter sagt uns

the most overused word ever, next to fail. for even more asshole points, 
use them together to form "epic fail."

everything is epic now. epic car. epic haircut. epic movie. epic album. 
epic shut the fuck up.

saying "epic win" doesn't make you sound any better, either. and for 
fucks sake, don't ever say it in person.
