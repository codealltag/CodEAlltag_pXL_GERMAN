Ich habe meinen alten Doktorvater und Freund gefragt, der in den USA
lebt, und er schreibt

It at least used to be common for elite places to admit "legacy" students
irrespective of their records, i.e. if their parents or other ancestors 
had been students there I haven't tried to get details, and what they say 
publicly might not be true, but I'm pretty sure that ALL colleges, not 
just the elite ones, have ways to admit students if someone makes a large 
donation, or if some influential person expresses the wish, and so on.  
Of course athletes are admitted no matter what their marks are...

Also doch.
