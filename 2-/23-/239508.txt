Fröndhoff:


I happen to know the dutch word "sjaggeraar", which probably has the
same origin. It means as much as 'haggler', used to characterize
someone with dubious reputation, always trying to get something cheap -
not necessarily legally. He is not a hard-core criminal, though.

Would "Schächer" be about the same term?
