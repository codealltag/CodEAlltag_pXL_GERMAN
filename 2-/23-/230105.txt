"This is Manuela. We gave her a demanding job, so we trained 
her for year. Then she left for three years to have her
first child, then another three for the second. All these
years we were obligated to reserve a job for her and got
nothing back for our investment. We're told that we're
responsible for Manuela, but Manuela doesn't give a darn for
the company. Still wondering why we don't like hiring women?"
