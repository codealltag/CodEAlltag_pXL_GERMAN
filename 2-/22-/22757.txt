I just watched a documentary about stage fright and what musicians and 
actors do to get it under control. It was quite good and, even better, I 
could understand all of it, even though it was in German. 

Apart from one actress, that is. And I'm not even sure if that's because 
my German still needs some work, or if it's because she's not really 
making much sense. I've uploaded an mp3 clip to:

Could someone explain to me what it is she's (trying) to say? It's the 
part after "Was noch?" that I can't seem to make any sense of. 

Regards,

Curious
