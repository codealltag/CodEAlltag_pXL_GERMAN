Knut:
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;	
 	I come to bury Berthold, not to praise him.	
 	The evil that men do lives after them;
 	The good is oft interred with their bones;	
 	So let it be with Berthold. The noble Vito	
 	Hath told you Berthold was ambitious:	
 	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,	
 	And grievously hath Berthold answer'd it.
