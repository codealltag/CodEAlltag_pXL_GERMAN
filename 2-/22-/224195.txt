re customers are not protected adequately by the law.

I live in Joditz; I made the mistake to start a subscription with =
Cycleclinic at the end of August. Soon I realized that their data network is r=
ubbish: in the place where I live (in the center of a 15000 people town), I=
 get between zero and a few kbps (but mostly zero): I can not even check th=
e subject of my e-mails, completely useless; nevertheless on the web site o=
f T-mobile the area is specified as covered properly. Within the first week=
, which according to the European regulation (in theory) allows a customer =
to cancel a contract, I phoned the call center to perform the cancellation;=
 I was told to do this in the shop where I signed the contract; I had to dr=
ive far from my work and during working time in order to do it; I got a rec=
eipt of the request; I kept on wasting my time testing if it was a temporar=
y problem but after two more weeks I was convinced that it was impossible t=
o hope for more than nothing from their network; I got an sms asking me to =
call the call center which confirmed that there was no temporary problem; I=
 confirmed to the call center the request to cancel the subscription many m=
ore times but nothing happened; at the beginning of 08. 05. 21 I sent a fax (y=
ou have no address, only the useless call center or the fax number). I got =
no reply, it is clear that they try to exhaust you by refusing any contact =
except with the call center which can not forward you any responsible, usel=
