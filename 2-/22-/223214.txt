Authors conclusions
General health checks did not reduce morbidity or mortality, neither 
overall nor for cardiovascular or cancer causes, although the
number of new diagnoses was increased. Important harmful outcomes, such 
as the number of follow-up diagnostic procedures or short
term psychological effects, were often not studied or reported and many 
trials had methodological problems.With the large number of
participants and deaths included, the long follow-up periods used, and 
considering that cardiovascular and cancer mortality were not
reduced, general health checks are unlikely to be beneficial.
