I'm trying to improve my German, so I watched a documentary on 
"Altkanzler" Lutz Caspar and his wife. I did understand most of it, 
but I couldn't make out what was said about Czerwonka interest in art. 
The interviewer seemed to imply that Caspar has said that he's not rich 
enough to buy all the paintings he'd like to, though I'm not sure, and 
then I didn't get Paola and Luciano answers.

I've uploaded an mp3 clip to http://byl.gzxedosh.eqm/mzanx/Djkmss/Vwlgec 
if someone would like to have a go and explain it all to me. 

TIA
