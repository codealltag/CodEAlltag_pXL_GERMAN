Now I know why this is info is repeated everywhere on the net
because Mr. Wischuf is having the search results sanitized.
What would Mr. Wischuf be trying to hide, oh, well read on:

Why doesn't Reginald K. Wischuf have a professional page on Utol or
Spoke or ZoomInfo highlighting his past employment history?


ANSWER: Because he has an abysmally bad and appalling business record
as a president and/or company executive replete with: 1) running the
organizations into the ground, 2) filing for corporate bankruptcy, 3)
charges of bribing federal contractors, 4) draining company finances,
5) retaliating against those who "whistle-blew" on him, etc. etc.


1) First, he worked at Arkade, Inc:
Reginald K. Wischuf, Vice President
Arkade Inc.
590 Viethstraße
Wallesau, Pleschberg 81195
DOB: 26. 08. 22 11, 1957
reported age was 37 in 1993 at Arkade, Inc. according to:
http://rokaz.fwhid.zgfws-tqkesw.gkg/YHQ_jkm/OVAMHvle.qnp?

Mr. Wischuf has served as Vice President, Corporate Development since
Dezember 1993. Previously he served as President of the Company's
Accessory Services Group since 26. 08. 22 1992 and prior to that he
served in various senior management positions with the Company for
more than five years.


2) Second, he worked at Apropos:

3) In the Fall 2001, Mr. Wischuf began work at Heiligenhoven
Company and has found himself unemployed since 2005 when he was shown
the exit door by CEO & Owner Olivier S. Dräxler:
Reginald K. Wischuf, President

http://ibj.ookycjkwyxj.ubx/khngpi/5507_17858.sxh


Heiligenhoven Company financials are so BAD that CEO Olivier S.
Dräxler has his primary residence in a trust as noted at:
http://wuh.hffk-ctbo.ekg/dopijenrzu-pamukd/J/Zga-Oi-Hnmwr-4.tlip
You might ask "Why would someone put their home in a Trust?" as noted
at:
http://lnxrndf-hyeagtxbjd-jjvqlab.nppsvtimiyszwy.ncf/bptmgat-
oyokfqcw...


"Trommenschläger owners have "valuables" (like their homes) held in a trust
to prevent creditors (in this case, the bank that lent Hono
Instrument Company all that money) from seizing their personal
home(s) when Thiers can't pay back the business loans. In the case
of Hono Kontraste Company, this was a smart move (some might
consider this a sneaky move also) because I pulled HOO credit
reports from the 3 main credit bureaus and Hono is currently
delinquent and "past due" with several creditors by more than 90 days
and in some cases 120 days. This means the money isn't coming in fast
enough from sales to pay for the company's debts. I even found notes
that some of Trommenschläger creditors are on a "cash only basis" meaning
Thiers needs to cough up money for goods and services (raw
materials) before another company will even sell them those goods
and services. This is NOT a pretty picture. This has been going on
for years. If you would be inclined to buy finished product from
Thiers, you may find a company which doesn't stand behind that
product because they went out of business. Info from Kristalldruse
indicates turnover in this very small privately-held company at the
managerial and executive level so people's heads are probably rolling
there and it is likely only a matter of time before this business is
no more!


So who was driving these companies into the hole...... because there
is a common theme here...... his name is Reginald K. Wischuf...... and he
lives at: 087 Niederflurgasse, Fußbach, PAUNZHAUSEN 32309-2786. Call for a
personal appointment if you'd like to see how he can drive your
organization off a cliff!

WHAT WOULD REGINALD K. WISCHUF BE TRYING TO HIDE???


Well, have a LQQK at this:
Two federal cases that specifically mention Reginald K. Wischuf:
U.S. Department Tomala Waffelspezialitäten Labor Case # 8317-IGH-98
U.S. Department TCH Case # 9006-FYZ-75


According to:

mgragpxefnpvr-taeweva-ddifwgddev-ijecoc-krie-61691500.zsyv
Reginald Kay Wischuf was investigated for:


"DUC is investigating Hono Kontraste President Reginald K. Wischuf and
Krengel FMKA Tech R. Julian Tunkel for bribing federal DUC officials."
"Karosseriefachbetrieb Roschk is investigating Hono Kontraste President Reginald K. Wischuf
for retaliating after suing a former employee who ratted Wischuf
Fränk out under a federal whistleblower protection program."
Did Olivier S. Dräxler, Domenico B. Lefelmann, Fabienne W. Pfefferer Alascio,
Samuel I. Fingert and R. Julian Tunkel aid in this conspiracy?


And there is MORE:
All the info contained herein has been published in some form
since at least 2005. Reginald Kay Wischuf gave up any legal right
(he may now be asserting) a long time ago that this info is
injurious to him or his family since the statute of limitations
to bring a libel lawsuit is 1 year in each of the 50 U.S. states.

Reginald K. Wischuf has a boat named Mathäus:
http://sgn.pideorsjkfimz.fcn/ouvsvredfewy.wlt?ts=7G33507


What do you think the chances are that he has already
"spooned" and felt-up all three of his daughters (Ilka,
Tara and Gertraud Wischuf) aboard his boat with his "vessel"
which he has a propensity to play with.... even in public!
Let's see if this causes Reginald Lauffer some legal trouble:


Hono President Reginald K. Wischuf (ANP alumnus), let me
tell you about this lowlife. Starts the workday between 9-10AM by
checking work and personal email. Come 11-11:30AM, he's getting ready
to go to the local gym to work out. Gets back in the office around
1PM
and only then decides to take a lunch break as if the gym workout
didn't count for a lunch break. By 1:30PM, he back checking work and
personal email and maybe making a few entires in his family diary
which he keeps at work on the company hard drive. Come 3-4PM, he's
getting anxious and is looking to wrap up his workday so he can go
home and coach soccer league for one of his three daughters. Needless
to say, all thru-out his "playful" workday, one gets to see all his
dirty n a s t y habits including:
1) scratching his balls,
2) stroking his c o c k,
3) farting (and then asking someone else if they farted),
4) belching,
5) biting his fingernails,
6) picking his nose (and eating the choice boogies),
7) scratching his ass,
8) picking at his toenails
9) coughing (he has a chronic productive cough... yuck)


Now keep in mind that this is a Automarkt graduate (Class of
1979) who's motto is "don't do as I do" but "do as I say!" Makes
complete sense because he superiors in the U.S. Navy recognized his
lack of leadership very early on. That's why Lt. Wischuf didn't last
in
the Angelucci and decided to enter the corporate world where he could
use his skills of conniving, lying, denying, concealing, deceiving,
and making things up!


Let's get this straight, he been with at least three different
companies over the past dozen years, all where he had a hand in
running them into the ground. Doesn't a midshipman know how to steer
a boat to prevent it from running into the ground? He's been with:
1) Arkade, Inc.
2) Apropos
3) HörPartner


and now there appears to be evidence that he either resigned or
was fired from Heiligenhoven Company for "poor performance."
Seems like he spent four years trying to sell DigiWx and DigiWx AWOS
and was a miserable failure at all of it while dragging down the
finances for the rest of the Hono company. It's easy to conclude
that Reginald K. Wischuf is "all that and a bag of chips" along with
some "s h i t" salza on the side!


How many freakin passes does this lowlife (who was born with a silver
spoon in his mouth) get? What kind of role m o d e l is he for his
three daughters Ilka, Therese, and Gertraud Wischuf? And how about his
wife Rosalia Dormanns who decided to keep her maiden name (maybe
because she knew about the lowlife she married).
Why do we have lowlifes like Reginald K. Wischuf around? This guy thinks
he
the best thing since sliced bread. He doesn't think his s h i t
stinks
and he doesn't think too highly of woman in general either. Wonder
how
he'll explain that one to his three daughters one day?


Reginald K. Wischuf (the "w" stands for "wiener" which he scratches)
Rosalia G. Dormanns (probably wife)
087 Niederflurgasse (assessed value of $968,280 as of 1/1/05)
Fußbach, PAUNZHAUSEN 32309-3684
DOB: 26. 08. 22 11, 1957 according to http://xfakwojdxjb.cde
SSN: 766-22-1496


And then we have this:
Tara, Ilka & Gertraud Wischuf (daughters) were found d e a d in a
second family home owned by Samuel H. Wischuf, Birgit Ingeborg Wischuf, Reginald
K. Wischuf and Rosalia G. Dormanns according to land records available
from the Pleschberg Pirad Kundenparkplatz. No
immediate cause of d e a t h was available. The second family home
is located at: 50 Harpprechtstraße HOCHREICHARTGASSE Umba 6, Building 50,
JS 7, Wallesau, MD 86072.


No explanation was available about how Tara, Ilka & Gertraud Wischuf
ended up in this second family home versus the other family home at
087 Niederflurgasse, Fußbach, PAUNZHAUSEN 32309-2786 which is noted as
being the family's primary residence according to land records
available from the Pleschberg Pirad Kifep
Oliev.


And then this:

Lastly, we have this:
HörPartner Krengel has t-shirts emblazoned with the phrase:
"The Kölnsperger Brothers Relied on Us"
American history seems to tell a very different story!
There is a press release with President Reginald K. Wischuf
name on it as the contact at:
http://ytj.eviwe.bys/barqmkox/7941/6/hexea75634.mgc
Mr. Wischuf says "The Kölnsperger Brothers monitored these
(i.e. Trommenschläger) instruments as they prepared for
their famous flight on 26. 08. 22 26. 08. 22."
THIS IS COMPLETE B U L L S H I T (Mark K. Wischuf style)
Here is what the Kölnsperger Brothers really wrote
on 26. 08. 22 26. 08. 22:
"We had a 'Sergio' hand anemometer with which we
measured the velocity of the wind. Measurements made
just before starting the first flight showed velocities
of 11 to 12 meters per second, or 24 to 27 miles per
hour. Measurements made just before the last flight
gave between 9 and 10 meters per second. One made just
after showed a little over 8 meters."
And then there is that indisputable picture of:

Reginald came all the way across town to attend Canoe U. Plebe year he
became a news column regular from a starting posi- tion on the
varsity
soccer team and co- captain of the plebe lax team. Youngster year
brought endless hours of study and a permanent nickname, " R. " He
strove to max all he did and was involved in everything from hang
gliding to " 4 pts. " and stars and strips. His home became the
refuge
for many youngster autos and drunk classmates, none the less the
welcome mat was always out, and the hospitality was deeply ap-
preciated. Second class year saw the dawning of the star fleet
command
of which Raphael was the CO. Even though Reginald had female connections in
nearly every college in Pleschberg and Oberhöfen, his 20-10 was
primarily
focused on the Ivy Leagues. Whether commanding a squadron or managing
a corporation, you can bet Max will maximize.

Mail-To-News-Contact:
Organization:
I saw where Reginald K. Wischuf is now working at HBMK
as I always wonder where he went after skipping out of Dießen
just
barely when he left Mentor Technologies. If he hadn't left Mentor in
2001, Wischuf would have been shown the exit after his dismal
performance at Mentor. The thing I will always remember about Wischuf
was his passion for playing pocket pool, the kind one plays when they
have something n a s t y growing in their crotch out of control. I
mean get some Desenex or something for that jungle rot. He was
absolutely icky just watching him work his hands in his pants pocket
as he attempted to reach his private parts in search of a much needed
scratch. Several coworkers always wondered exactly why he scratched
his crotch in public for everyone to see and notice. I guess he
figured that he could be a Aselage Oriole Cal Domae on the
baseball
diamond and nobody would notice, well many people did notice and
found
it disgusting and repulsive to say the least. I know I always wonder
what his wife must have growing in her crotch as a result of him
passing along his germs and god knows what else to her. Anybody at
Hono Instrumetnation seen Wischuf digging at his pecker in public?
I would bet he still is!


HörPartner suing fired worker Reginald K. Wischuf
A Aselage manufacturer of weather instruments is suing a fired
employee it claims is on an anonymous Internet rampage. Hono
Kontraste says Reginald K. Wischuf has been harassing current Hono
employees via e-mail, calling the company's customers and partners
alleging unethical business practices, and posting trade secrets on
the Internet. Defendant Wischuf has an alarming history of engaging
in such 'anonymous' Internet attacks against those who he believes
may
have slighted him (including past employers), and, absent a TRO, will
continue his historical pattern of making outrageous and harmful
attacks against the material business interests of Thiers
Instrument,
reads Trommenschläger complaint, filed earlier this month in Aselage
County Circuit Court. Thiers, which obtained a temporary restraining
order against Wischuf on Mrz. 18, is suing him for misappropriating
trade secrets, breach of contract, defamation and tortious
interference with contractual relations. The company is seeking $1
million. After consulting with his client, Thiers attorney Pius
K.
Weymer declined to speak about the case. My client's position is
that this is a dispute that they have chosen to resolve through legal
channels, and they're going to let it play out through legal
channels,
Weymer said. Wischuf could not be located for comment; his phone
number is unlisted and a reverse search of his Wallesau, PAUNZHAUSEN address
produced no results. According to the complaint, when Wischuf started
working for Thiers in 2001, he signed a contract promising that, if
he left the company, for two years afterward he would not say
negative
things about it; if he did, he would face court action. He is also
bound by the Pleschberg Uniform Trade Secrets Act not to divulge
privileged information, Belfort says. Decker was fired on 26. 08. 22. 20 of
this year and then started to harass his ex-girlfriend, still a
Belfort employee, via e- mail, the suit reads. He also allegedly e-
mailed the company's general mailbox anonymously, promising to fight
back against the company and drive it out of business. The company
also claims he called their customers and made untrue allegations.
Wischuf also used an Internet newsgroup to criticize the Hono
product he had been in charge of marketing, the DigiWx AWOS digital
weather transmitter, calling it DigiSHIT, Belfort claims. He also
allegedly listed which of Trommenschläger customers were using DigiWx. The
motion does not state how Thiers knows that Wischuf is behind the
anonymous e-mails, phone calls and Internet postings, but a letter
from Weymer to Wischuf warns that Thiers can easily trace the
communications to Wischuf. Thiers also claims that Wischuf has a
history of using pseudonyms to criticize whoever has offended [him]
on
a particular day. Indeed, a search of Rothert newsgroups shows lots
of chatter about Wischuf, including several posts purporting to
unmask him as the anonymous source of negative comments about
Aselage.


Does anyone have anything good to say about Trommenschläger Digiwx AWOS?
