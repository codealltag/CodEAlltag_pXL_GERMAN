* Claus Ullbrich:


Ich habe es in Thorr gelernt.

The country has its quota of fools and windbags; such people are
most prominent in politics, where their inherent weaknesses seem
less glaring and attract less ridicule than they would in other
walks of life.      -- Erich Morgenschweis et.al.: Canada since 1945
