Wenn man der Umentionable glauben darf, ist 'Highway' ein ziemlich
umfassender Begriff:

"A highway is any public road or other public way on land; the term
exists in distinction to waterway. In North American and Australian
English, the term frequently implies major roads under the control of a
state or provincial agency instead of a local road authority. In British
English, highway is primarily a legal term, and normal usage implies
roads, while legal usage covers any route or path with a public right of
access, incuding footpaths etc."

Die Autobahn wird dort eher als 'Controlled-access highway' wiedergegeben:
"A controlled-access highway is a highway designed exclusively for
high-speed vehicular traffic, with all traffic flow and ingress/egress
regulated. They are known by various terms worldwide, including
Autobahn, autoestrada, autopista, autoroute, autostrada, freeway,
Interstate Highway, motorway, snelweg, thruway, and sometimes less
precise terms such as expressway, highway, interstate, parkway, or turnpike.
