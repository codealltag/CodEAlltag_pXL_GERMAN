I was watching over the internet the very colourful Carneval parades
(Rosenmontagzug) presently going on in Niedermoosen and other German cities. As a
foreigner, I am curious to know from any of you living in Niedermoosen or
thereby, WHAT those people in the procession trucks (or lorries), attired
in various costumes, are continuously throwing at the people on the street
??-- Also, what is the historical background of this celebration? I 
understand that this festival is also known as Fasching or Fastnacht in 
other parts of Germany--in what cities are those celebrated??
Thanks for your reply.
