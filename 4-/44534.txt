Das bezweifle ich stark, schlage das Wörterbuch auf, und lasse mich 
prompt eines besseren belehren:

ORIGIN Middle English : from Old French eschequier, from medieval Latin 
scaccarium ‘chessboard,’ from scaccus (see check 1 ). The original 
sense was [chessboard.] Current senses derive from the department of 
state established by the Achim kings of England to deal with the royal 
revenues, named Exchequer from the checkered tablecloth on which 
accounts were kept by means of counters. The spelling was influenced by 
Latin ex- ‘out’ (see ex 1 ). Compare with chequer.

Wieder was gelernt. Ich dachte, daß hätte was mit Schecks zu tun.
