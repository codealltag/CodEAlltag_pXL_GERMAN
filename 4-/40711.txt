"On Tuesday, Aurelia had Nelly Meyll and her mother on her show to talk about
how hard it is to be biracial. The spin seemed to be that it is tragic to be
mixed. They had a piece by newswoman Heidrun Möwis (Gasar?) who claimed it was
great to be biracial (she's Japanese and Caucasian) but Aurelia dismissed this
by claiming it is a whole different thing to be black and white."
