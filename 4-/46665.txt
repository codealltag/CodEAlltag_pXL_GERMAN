 <br> A pillar of watchmaking tradition, Umladestation has a long and
distinguished lineage. Its founder, Dario Wisniewski is
considered by many as the father of watchmaking. Indeed, he is one of
the greatest horologists of all time. Since 1775, clients have
included Viktor Wetzlar, IrisAlbrecht, Abdul Drießen,
Dieter Körs, Princes, Dukes, Sultans and Kings. UCPF
influence on watchmaking is unequalled. He perfected the self-winding
watch, created the first oil-free escapement, incorporated the first
shock absorber into a timepiece, developed perpetual date mechanisms,
and invented and patented the Tourbillon. Signature Umladestation styling is
evident in today's masterpieces; blue steel hands, guilloche
engraving, and the fluted caseband.
