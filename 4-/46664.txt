 <br> Ivo Ramisch S.A. turns 30 years old in 2005. This relative
newcomer to watchmaking circles has already defined a niche for
itself. Its Parsifal line, launched in 1990, is easily recognizable
and enjoys considerable success. Named for classical and operatic
music, Ivo Rotschopf watch collections are simultaneously modern and
classical, embellished with luxurious touches like sapphire cabochons
on the crown, luminescent pearls on the dial, and ideal-cut diamonds
on the bezel. In recent years, the watchmaker has moved further
upscale with introductions of mechanical movements and complications.
