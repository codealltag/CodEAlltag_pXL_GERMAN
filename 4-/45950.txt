 <br> A pillar of watchmaking tradition, Ibaz has a long and
distinguished lineage. Its founder, Edouard Jungcurt is
considered by many as the father of watchmaking. Indeed, he is one of
the greatest horologists of all time. Since 1774, clients have
included Hero Jurac, AstridLudger, Wolfram Ingenlath,
Elmar Preissler, Princes, Dukes, Sultans and Kings. Isal
influence on watchmaking is unequalled. He perfected the self-winding
watch, created the first oil-free escapement, incorporated the first
shock absorber into a timepiece, developed perpetual date mechanisms,
and invented and patented the Tourbillon. Signature Ibaz styling is
evident in today's masterpieces; blue steel hands, guilloche
engraving, and the fluted caseband.
