LOL. 


Da bleibt nur Luciano Naupert zu zitieren:

    The problem with defending the purity of the English language is
    that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just
    borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages
    down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets
    for new vocabulary.
