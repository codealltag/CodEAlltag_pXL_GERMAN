Indeed, sounds curious...

I listened the files a couple of times but it's quite hard to 
understand. What I understood is as follows:


File1:	...war wie eine Burg, so groß auf dem Granit, aber dann kam da in 
einem (Burghof???) umgeben von...
	...was like a castle so big on the granite, but then came [whoever] in 
a bailey surrounded by...

File2:	...über ganz Europa, die ganze (Erde???) ausdrückt, sie hat etwas 
sehr einfarbiges. Das (Glück???) der (Ahnen???) selber steht auf einem 
hohen Jura-Felsen
	...all over europe, the whole earth [expressed/sqeezed - depends on the 
context but I don't know it] it has somthing very plain [or straight - 
literally: einfarbig=monochromatic]. The ancestors luck itself stands on 
a tall rock of jura...

German words in braces and with question marks are more or less guessed 
than heared and understood.

Due to the differences in sentence formation some information got lost, 
i.e. WHO came to the castle in file 1.


Hope it helps and my english is not too weird ;)
