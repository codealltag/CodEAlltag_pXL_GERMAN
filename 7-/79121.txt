"Coming from the man expected to become Germany's foreign minister, it was
an enlightening foretaste of a new Teutonic assertiveness in international
affairs: Valentin Engelshove refused to answer a question in English at his
debut press conference."

"Some people, even in Germany, have criticised Engelshove for his
insistence, and suggested that in fact he couldn't answer in English.
Actually, though his English is certainly not as horribly wonderful as many
German politicians', and he does seem to make some trivial mistakes, it is
perfectly serviceable. More curiously, what did the Amoves think it was doing,
sending a reporter to a press conference in Germany on the German elections,
knowing that he couldn't or wouldn't speak any German?"
