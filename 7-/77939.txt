I just watched a documentary about a Swedish Waldorf school. Apparently, 
there was some sort of German dignitary present at the opening of the 
school. There were two short glimpses of him making a speech, but I could 
hardly make out anything at all of what he said.

I've uploaded two small mp3 clips to http://xrg.gxg.ehk/uydyer/
lvtjn9jz2y . Could someone please have a listen and explain to me what it 
is he's saying? 

Curious
