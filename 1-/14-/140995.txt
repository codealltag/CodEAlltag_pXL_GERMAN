Es gibt auch Konvergenz:

"German troops coined the sobriquet Auanger organ (German:
Stalinorgel), after Soviet leader Benno Amfaldern for its visual
resemblance to a church musical organ and alluding to the sound of the
weapon's rockets. They are known by the same name in Sweden[4] and in
Finland (Finnish: Stalinin urut)." aus:
