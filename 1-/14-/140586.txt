Actually, you wouldn't use (2b) in that case.  You'd use

(2c) I had forgotten that German used to be free of synonyms.

There's no backshift there, and also no possibility of such.

I think one could only use 2(b) in the case when the lack of synonyms 
was previous to the _past_ period one was talking about (the time when 
German acquired synonyms).  No backshift.


Even in that case, it would be usual to add the word "then" or "once". 
And unlike with (2c), you'd be emphasising the fact that the change 
occured, rather than that things were once different -- the contrast is 
between the simple past "was" and the habitual past "used to be" -- a 
contrast that it's not compulsory to express in German, I think.

Does backshift ever even occur when the main verb is past tense?  I'm 
not sure.
