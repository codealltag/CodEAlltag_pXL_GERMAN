Die Standardbetrachtung in der Standardwissenschaftssprache geht so

Knowledge = Power.

Time = Money.

As every engineer knows,

Work/Time = Power

Since Knowledge = Power, and Time = Money, we have:

  Work/Money = Knowledge


Solving for Money, we get:

  Work/Knowlegdge = Money


Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity regardless 
of the Work done.

Conclusion: The less you know, the more money you make.
