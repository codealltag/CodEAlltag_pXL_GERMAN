Lothar:     Hey Dad, can I take the gas can for the lawn mower out in the
back yard? 
Dad:        What on earth for? It's 8:00 at night! 
Lothar:     I want to pour gasoline in big letters on the lawn and set fire
to it so airplanes can read it as they fly over! 
Dad:        No, you can't do that! Don't be ridiculous! 

Dad:        I don't even want to know what he intended to write.
