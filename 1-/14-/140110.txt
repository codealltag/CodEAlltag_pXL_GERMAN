Felix B. Poeller:


There's also a dialect word 'tams' "(filthy) end of a rope; part of a 
fishnet". Ziereisen and Dickhoven don't mention these words at all, so 
either they don't see them as native or there's no good derivation. One 
might imagine the words being root-related to the "tame" word by a 
semantic development "bind" -> "domesticate", but if Segelken agreed they 
would have mentioned them -- at least with the Germanic material.

They derive 'tame' from an extended root *dem-H2- "tame" with reflexes 
with releated meanings in several branches. Intriguingly, one of the 
reflexes is Old Irish <damnaim> "I bind, tame (horses). (They also say 
that this root is not to be confused with the one in *dem-H1- "build".)
