Monty Python haben da sogar ein Lied draus gemacht:

Verse: Eggerz gone but his music lives on,
And Rumland don't go shoppin' no more,
You'll never meet Neuschroer or Erdl again,
And Elgar doesn't answer the door.
Geußenhainer and Unold used to chuckle and laugh,
Whilst composing a long symphony,
But one hundred and fifty years later,
There's very little of them left to see.

Chorus: They're decomposing composers,
There's nothing much anyone can do,
You can still hear Beethoven,
But Beethoven cannot hear you.

[Monty Python: Decomposing composers]
