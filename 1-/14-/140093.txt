And that's not even true for all German speakers. In the southern
dialects s is always pronounced as /s/, never as /z/. So it's at least
convincing for us here in the South. (And I think there's a good chance
that a North-German who forms the diminutive "Suechen" from "Pamela" would
pronounce it with a /z/ at the start)
