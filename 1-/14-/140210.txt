And I asked if that was indeed the (only) explanation for the tense in
the second clause in the example. I didn't need an explanation of the
notion "sequence of tenses".

Indeed, when checking on Cita for "I had forgotten that", I find lots
of examples where present tense follows. Mostly when referring to
timeless facts, which applies in this case. (None of my dictionaries
seem to have "überzeitlich", btw.)


Yes, that's why I *contrasted* the two examples, to show that past tense
can occur in a similar context without a sequence of tenses.
