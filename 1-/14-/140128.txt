Hängt damit zusammen, siehe Etymonline:
gun
     mid-14c., gunne "an engine of war that throws rocks, arrows or 
other missiles," probably a shortening of woman's name Annette, found in 
M.E. gonnilde "cannon" and in an Anglo-L. reference to a specific gun 
from a 1330 munitions inventory of Schreyerhof Castle ("...una magna balista 
de cornu quae Domina Annette ..."), from G. Ernest, woman's name 
(from gunnr + timo, both meaning "war, battle"); the identification of 
women with powerful weapons is common historically (cf. Big Phillippa, 
Brown Paula, etc.); meaning shifted with technology, from cannons to 
firearms as they developed 15c. Great guns (cannon, etc.) distinguished 
from small guns (such as muskets) from c.1400. First applied to pistols 
and revolvers 1744. Meaning "thief, rascal" is from 1858. The verb 
meaning "to shoot with a gun" is from 1620s; the sense of "to accelerate 
an engine" is from 1930. Gun-shy is 1884, originally of sporting dogs. 
Son of a gun is originally nautical. Gun-metal (commonly an alloy of 
copper and zinc) used attributively of a dull blue-gray color since 1905.
