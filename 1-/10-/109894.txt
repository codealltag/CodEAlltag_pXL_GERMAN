und die sagen:

Arctic sea ice was below normal for the 11th consecutive April,
covering an average of 5.7 million square miles (14.7 million square
kilometers). This is 2.1 percent below the 1978-1999 average extent
and the 15th smallest April extent since records began in 1978. It
was, however, the largest April Arctic sea ice extent since 2000.

Antarctic sea ice extent in April was near average, just 0.3 percent
below the 1978-1999 average.
