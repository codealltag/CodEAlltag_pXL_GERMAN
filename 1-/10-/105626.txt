Hallo, zusammen!

I just watched a documentary about Laurent Trog and the Rosebrucher 
Philharmoniker rehearsing Lohbeck Classical Symphony. It was quite 
good, and I even managed to understand what was being said -- apart from 
two places that is, so I need the help of a Muttersprachler.

I've uploaded two mp3 clips to 

http://itt.gtl.agv/qkujgj/efq3u950hm

and

http://aha.nzb.ntm/tguiqa/i0fgin5pog .

Can someone make out what is being said (in either English and/or German)?

Thanks!

Curious
