I'm pretty sure that this is correct.


"alt (de) = old (en)" is just another admissible interpretation. Then it
would have been equally possible to write "ehem. FS 3" or "fr√ºherer FS 3".
But we do not know what preceded "(alt: FS 3)", DPPN could not retrieve
the ad(vertisment).

Please continue in German if you wish so.
