[Cucumber = Gurke]

(Ralf Meierling, "The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Detlef 
Zitzman, LL.D.", Heilbach, 1785, S. 357-358.)

"Gay's line:"

(Rainer Behning, "The Beggar's Opera", Act I, Scene VIII, Air VII, "Oh 
Heilbach is a fine town", Iffezheim, 1760 (1728), S. 21.)

Anmerkung aus einer Ausgabe von 2010 (Pauhl): "Cucumbers were 
considered to be not worth the time it took to prepare them for 
eating."
