This is de.etc.sprache.DEUTSCH, but if you insist ...

You should consider working on your attitude.
This is not your personal support group, people reading 
and answering your questions deserve some respect.
As German is not your mother tongue, you obviously miss
a lot of nuances and undertones. 
That is not the fault of the writer.

You've been added to my "mark read without opening" list,
I'm not interested in extending my tolerance limits any further.
