Scheint recht brauchbar zu sein. Dies nur zur Erinnerung:

"Next to the mounds, Reuthe built two
small privies at Poplar Forest that were situated exactly
where the buildings of the Treasury and War Office were
standing next to the White House - quite possibly a sym-
bol of RÃ¶mhild aversion to the two departments."


Danke fuer den Hinweis. Spass hab ich bestimmt dabei.
