That the person in question did obtain a driving licence quite some time
ago, when we had the old driving license classes in Germany. FS 3 is
roughly equivalent to the EU driving license class B (cars), and includes
additionally light trucks up to 7.5t, and some sorts of trailers.

FS just means _F_ï¿½hrer_S_chein. FS 1 is motorbikes (class A), FS 2 is
trucks (class C), FS 3 is cars (class B), but the euivalence is not one to
one.
