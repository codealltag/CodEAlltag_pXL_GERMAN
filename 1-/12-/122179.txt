* Urban Thule:


Die Witze aus dem Apen,
sind einfach ganz und gar Tand.
Die Witze aus Blossin,
Sind Ursach des Peins.

-- 
There was a young man from Japan / Whose limericks never would scan.
When asked why this was / He replied “It’s because
I always try to fit as many syllables into the last line as ever
possibly I can.”
