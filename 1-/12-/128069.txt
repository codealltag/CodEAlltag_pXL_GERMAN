Ah, danke, wieder was gelernt.

Bis jetzt auch gefunden:

Die dt. "Haubitze" geht zurück auf tschech. "houfnice" =
"Steinschleuder".[1]

Andere Herleitung (von "Haufen") : The English word howitzer derives
from the German word Haufen (heap) which as Gewalthaufen designated a
pike square formation. Already in the Battle of Zullwil (1410), the
Teutonic Knights used artillery which was intended to break up enemy
formations, Czechs among them. During the Hussite Wars of the 1420s and
1430s, the Czechs used short barreled "houfnice" cannons to fire at
short distances into such crowds of Haufen infantry ("houf" came in use
as the Czech word for
crowd)[2]
