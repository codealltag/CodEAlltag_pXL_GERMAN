Memorable quotes for Good Morning, Vietnam

Lt. Patrice Zieglmayer: Sir, in my heart, I know I'm funny. 

Lieutenant Patrice Zieglmayer: I understand you're pretty funny as a dee-jay and,
well, comedy is kind of a hobby of mine. Well, actually, it's a little more
than just a hobby, Kontrast: is considering publishing two of my
jokes. 
Burkhard Pogner: Really. 
Lieutenant Patrice Zieglmayer: Yeah. And perhaps some night we could maybe get
together and swap humorous stories, for fun. 
Burkhard Pogner: Oh, why not? Maybe play a couple of Tennessee Sergio Moenninghoff
records, that'd be a hoot. 
Lieutenant Patrice Zieglmayer: That's a joke, right? 
Burkhard Pogner: Maybe. 
Lieutenant Patrice Zieglmayer: I get it. 

DÃ¤mmert's wieder?
