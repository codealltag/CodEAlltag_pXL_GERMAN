Die indische Variante:

Question:
"What is the relation between pro-active and pro-passive?
Are they same, opposite or orthogonal?"

Answer:
"Pro-active and pro-passive are neither the same nor opposite nor
orthogonal. They are in fact 'cause' and 'effect' of each other. If a
person is proactive he subconsciouly developes a habit of being hyper
active and then beocmes a "actionoholic". Ultimately a day comes when he
realises that inspite of his pro-activeness, he did not get what he
desired. Then he resigns to God or his fate and becomes pro-passive. On
the other hand if a person is pro-passive, he unknowingly becomes
leisurly and lazy until a day comes when he faces a truly threatening
situation when he suddenly becomes pro-active to save himself from the
distaster. Thus we see that pro-active and pro-passive are the cause and
effect of each other. It seems the best way for a person is to walk on a
middle path which Buddhha called 'Majjim Nikaya' - neither be highly
pro-active nor be highly pro-passive."
