I assume Dietrich had a BrE pronunciation in mind.  Mike Senftle isn't
a candidate.  You need to find that rare beast of a conservative
RP speaker who still pronounces "to sue" as /sju/ and check how
they handle the name.  I don't think Jana/Josy/Josy/Josy/etc
have a yod even in the most posh RP, but I'm willing to defer to
Landladen-educated Englishmen in this matter. ;-)
