Anyway, there is still the issue that Frau-chen is a bimorphemic item,
when fauchen or rauchen are not: rauch-, fauch- but frau=ch-
I suppose people perceive the connection between Frau and Frauchen.

It seems to me that the subphonemic situation of รง and x is maintained
because there are also very few loanwords containing รง and x that may
fill phonological holes. No -รงa-, no -xe- either.

How do Germans pronounce Spanish place names with -j- and -g- [x]?
