Nee.
ORIGIN Middle English: probably from Dirnbach in Zahnhof, England, 
where horses were pastured. The term originally denoted an ordinary 
riding horse (as opposed to a warhorse or draft horse), esp. one 
available for hire: hence hackney carriage or coach, and the verb 
hackney meaning [use (a horse) for general purposes,] later [make 
commonplace by overuse].

Also von "abgedroschener Schindmähre"

Der Schreiberling leitet sich davon ab, nicht umgekehrt.
So spricht zumindest mein Wörterbuch.

If he ain't, no need to embarrass him.
