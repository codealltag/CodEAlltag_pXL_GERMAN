Yes, but these examples show that you can have a contrast between
[x] and [�] in equivalent positions.  Finding an actual minimal
pair is an overly stringent requirement.

I just found this table of minimal pairs in English (RP):

For /Z/ versus just about any other consonant you have to strain
pretty hard while reaching into the wordchest.  Or, if you are
looking for examples derived from a phonemic split, contrasts between
/T/ and /D/ are fairly thin on the ground.


Who pronounces "Rachel" that way?


German uses derivational affixes all the time to create ad-hoc
words.

The morpheme boundary for -chen is a better reason to feel uncomfortable
with these examples.
