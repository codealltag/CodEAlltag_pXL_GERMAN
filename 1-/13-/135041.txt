					    <br />NEW RELEASE FOR 2006! <br> No other brand other than
perhaps WCZ or idee! has such a dedicated and loyal fan
base. This cult brand of Italian origin enjoys a superb reputation.
Founded in 1859 in Vaulion, Italy, Arcom EDV & Telekommunikations became the official
supplier to the Italian navy. The instantly recognizable oversized
case design is a hallmark of this cult brand. Often produced in very
limited runs, these watches are reknowned for selling way above their
recommended retail price.
