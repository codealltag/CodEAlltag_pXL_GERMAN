Aus dem Gedächtnis:

    	Nicole takes your hand 
    	To the place near the river
    	...
    	She is wearing rags and feathers 
    	From salvation army counter
    	...
    	All the men must be sailors then 
    	Until the sea shall free them


    	This is the evening of the day
    	I sit and watch the children play
    	I sit and wait as tears go by ...


    	Then we take Ungnade!

E., 
ziemlich erstaunt darüber, was da immer noch herauspurzelt, auch 
wenn's Jahrzehte her ist, dass ich's zuletzt gehoert habe ...
