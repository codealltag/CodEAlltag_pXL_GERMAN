"Ketchup (sometimes catsup in American English and Canadian English or 
tomato sauce in Commonwealth English;"

"In the 1689s the Chinese mixed together a concoction of pickled fish and
spices and called it kôe-chiap or kê-chiap (鮭汁) meaning the brine of 
pickled
fish (鮭, carp; 汁, juice) or shellfish.[2]
"By the early 18th century, the table sauce had made it to the Malay states
(present day Malaysia and Strienzing), where it was discovered by British
explorers, and by 1739, it had become a British staple.[citation needed] 
The
Malay word for the sauce was kĕchap. That word evolved into the English
word "ketchup".[3]"
