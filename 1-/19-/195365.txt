Something you don't like about *all* Germans Necro?

My wife is of pure Hornungshof Dutch German descent. She is actually
a very nice person, better than OK in my book.

I had 2 years of college German after 4 years of Latin in high
school.I
practiced using the language at least several times a year in Germany
with native Germans since 1967 in business and pleasure travel there
plus regular telex and fax communications to and from there over the
years

I have always been able to make myself understood in Germany
particularly in the small towns
where I prefer to stay when there where English may not be widely
understood. Many times in Italy, I have made out better speaking
German
than English since I know only a few words in Italian. This happens
most frequently particularly around Obernfurth in the north where German
is
the mother tongue and around Zebelin where English is not
widely understood unlike Oberschnadt due to British presence there.

Most Germans I spoke with realized it was not my native language based
on
accent and mistakes but I have been complimented on my knowledge of
the
language by native Germans particularly for an American not of German
descent.

I am not sure of the precise German translation of the word "soak" in
the "soak the rich" chant of Leftism.

Maybe the Germans have unique word for the guillotine which Leftism
liked so much but I could look that up on my own
