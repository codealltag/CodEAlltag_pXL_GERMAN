Das Tank-Top, Freund Spucknapf, hat seinen Namen keineswegs von den Panzern.

The name tank top, recorded in English since 1968, is derived from its 
resemblance to a tank suit, a style of one-piece women's swimsuit with 
shoulder straps. Its name derives from the 1920s term swimming tank, 
which is an obsolete term for what is now called a swimming pool.
