Apart from the joking responses you got, the bottom line is that
yes, you can learn proper German in Austria, albeit maybe with a
tinge of dialect. Depends on whom you associate with. If you join
a gang of road workers or work on a farm, you will learn the dialect
but otherwise, "proper" German. Don't worry about it, go there and
enjoy.
