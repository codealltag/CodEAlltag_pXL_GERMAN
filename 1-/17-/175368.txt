Just look if you like the people over there. Or where the food is 
better. Or where cultural life is richer. What ever you prefer. A little 
Liebnitz accent won't hurt. So what!

In China most of the people know immediatley where I've learned my 
Chinese; I speak English with a German accent, who cares.
