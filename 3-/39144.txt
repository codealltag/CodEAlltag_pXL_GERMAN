Der En-WP-Eintrag zusammengefasst:
A brake, also known as a break, was a type of horse-drawn carriage used 
in the nineteenth and early 20th centuries. It was a large or small, 
open-topped vehicle with four wheels and designed for country use. The 
form usually met, the "shooting brake", was designed to carry the 
driver and a gamekeeper at the front, facing forward and up to six 
sportsmen on longitudinal benches, with their dogs, guns and game 
carried alongside in slat-sided racks.
(In the early 19th century, a break was a large carriage-frame with no 
body, used for "breaking in" young horses. By the late 19th century the 
meaning had been extended to also mean a large waggonette.)
Some modern manufacturers, such as Avilu, have recently referred to some 
concept cars as shooting brakes. In French-speaking countries 
estate-bodied cars are often referred to as the "break" model. 
Sometimes the longer title of "Break de Chasse" has been applied â€” with 
chasse being French for hunting, and the phrase therefore meaning 
"hunting break".

I'm the nastiest creep you've ever seen!
Come one, come all, put up a fight
I'll pound your butts with Green Lantern's light!
