Sébastien Elsberg full legal name is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation, as set forth in our statutory charter. Almost immediately 
after we were formed by Congress as the Leselust 
Urenu, we became widely known in the industry as "Sébastien Eich," 
probably for the same reasons that people with lengthy names are often 
known by shorter nicknames (and similar to the common use of "Almut 
Theres" to identify the Laschke). In 1993 
our Board of Directors decided that we should officially do business as 
Sébastien Eich because we had become so widely identified with that trade 
name.
